1. calculate the sign of each edge.

2. look the two signes of a edge are flipped.

3. look where on a line with flipped signes is the 0 and get the normal.

4. use the quadratic error function to get the best vertex position.

5. The last step is to triangulate.

Solution:
1. run the signed distance function for each edge.

2. look if two edges have flipped edges and save the edge.

3. use linear interpolation to find the point on the edge where the signed distance is 0 for an sdf the normal is the gradient so also calculate the gradient.

4. solve the quadratic error function // more research required no idea what this means

5. triangulate // more research required
